      <p>GPT-3 is a computer program created by the privately held San Francisco startup OpenAI. It is a gigantic neural network, and as such, it is part of the deep learning segment of machine learning, which is itself a branch of the field of computer science known as artificial intelligence, or AI. The program is better than any prior program at producing lines of text that sound like they could have been written by a human.
</p>
<p>The reason that such a breakthrough could be useful to companies is that it has great potential for automating tasks. GPT-3 can respond to any text that a person types into the computer with a new piece of text that is appropriate to the context. Type a full English sentence into a search box, for example, and you're more likely to get back some response in full sentences that is relevant. That means GPT-3 can conceivably amplify human effort in a wide variety of situations, from questions and answers for customer service to due diligence document search to report generation.
The program is currently in a private beta for which people can sign up on a waitlist. It's being offered by OpenAI as an API accessible through the cloud, and companies that have been granted access have developed some intriguing applications that use the generation of text to enhance all kinds of programs, from simple question-answering to producing programming code.
GPT-3 is an example of what's known as a language model, which is a particular kind of statistical program. In this case, it was created as a neural network. </p>
